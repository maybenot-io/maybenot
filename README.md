# Maybenot

Maybenot is a framework for traffic analysis defenses that hide patterns in
encrypted communication. Its goal is to increase the uncertainty of network
attackers, hence its logo ðŸ¤” - the thinking face emoji (U+1F914).

Consider encrypted communication protocols such as TLS, QUIC, WireGuard, or Tor.
While the connections are encrypted, *patterns* in the encrypted communication
may still leak information about the communicated plaintext. Maybenot is a
framework for creating defenses that hide such patterns.

## Workspace structure

The Maybenot workspace consists of the following crates:

- [maybenot](crates/maybenot): The core framework for creating defenses.
- [maybenot-ffi](crates/maybenot-ffi): A wrapper library around maybenot with a C FFI.
- [maybenot-simulator](crates/maybenot-simulator): A simulator for testing
  defenses.

More crates are being added to the workspace. First up should be an FFI crate
for the framework.

## More details

This is v2 of the framework and associated crates. The goal is to keep the
framework as simple as possible, while still being expressive enough to
implement a wide range of defenses and useful to integrators.

See the [WPES 2023 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3603216.3624953) for
background on v1 of the framework. The
[documentation](https://docs.rs/maybenot/latest/maybenot) is updated for v2. The
[arXiv design document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09510) is in the process of
being updated for version 2.

Development of defenses using Maybenot is under active development. For some
early results targeting v1 of the framework, see
[https://github.com/ewitwer/maybenot-defenses](https://github.com/ewitwer/maybenot-defenses).
Defenses and tooling targeting v2 of the framework will soon be available.

## Origin

Maybenot is based on the [Circuit Padding Framework of
Tor](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/doc/HACKING/CircuitPaddingDevelopment.md)
by Perry and Kadianakis from 2019, which is a generalization of the [WTF-PAD
Website Fingerprinting Defense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00524.pdf) design by
Juarez et al. from 2016, which in turn is based on the concept of [Adaptive
Padding](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_esorics06.pdf) by Shmatikov and
Wang from 2006.
