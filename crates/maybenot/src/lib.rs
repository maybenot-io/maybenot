//! Maybenot is a framework for traffic analysis defenses that hide patterns in
//! encrypted communication.
//!
//! Consider encrypted communication protocols such as QUIC, TLS, Tor, and
//! WireGuard. While the connections are encrypted, *patterns* in the encrypted
//! communication may still leak information about the underlying plaintext
//! despite being encrypted. Maybenot is a framework for creating and executing
//! defenses that hide such patterns. Defenses are implemented as probabilistic
//! state machines.
//!
//! If you want to use Maybenot, see the below example and [`Framework`] for
//! details. As a user, that is typically all that you need and the other
//! modules can be ignored. Note that you create an existing [`Machine`] (for
//! use with the [`Framework`]) using the [`core::str::FromStr`] trait.
//!
//! If you want to build machines for the [`Framework`], take a look at all the
//! modules. For top-down, start with the [`Machine`] type. For bottom-up, start
//! with [`dist`], [`event`], [`action`], and [`counter`] before [`state`] and
//! finally [`Machine`].
//!
//! ## Example usage
//! ```
//! use maybenot::{Framework, Machine, TriggerAction, TriggerEvent};
//! use std::{str::FromStr, time::Instant};
//! // This is a large example usage of the Maybenot framework. Some parts
//! // are a bit odd due to avoiding everything async but should convey the
//! // general idea.
//!
//! // Parse machine, this is a "no-op" machine that does nothing.
//! // Typically, you should expect to get one or more serialized machines,
//! // not build them from scratch. The framework takes a vector with zero
//! // or more machines as input when created. To add or remove a machine,
//! // just recreate the framework. If you expect to create many instances
//! // of the framework for the same machines, then share the same vector
//! // across framework instances. All runtime information is allocated
//! // internally in the framework without modifying the machines.
//! let s = "02eNpjYEAHjOgCAAA0AAI=";
//! // machines will error if invalid
//! let m = vec![Machine::from_str(s).unwrap()];
//!
//! // You create the framework, a lightweight operation, with the following
//! // parameters:
//! // - A vector of zero or more machines.
//! // - Max fractions prevent machines from causing too much overhead: note
//! // that machines can be defined to be allowed a fixed amount of
//! // padding/blocking, bypassing these limits until having used up their
//! // allowed budgets. This means that it is possible to create machines
//! // that trigger actions to block outgoing traffic indefinitely and/or
//! // send a lot of outgoing traffic.
//! // - The current time. For normal use, just provide the current time as
//! // below. This is exposed mainly for testing purposes (can also be used
//! // to make the creation of some odd types of machines easier).
//! // - A random number generator. Typically, this should be a secure
// random number generator, like the one provided by the `rand` crate.
//! //
//! // The framework validates all machines (like ::From_str() above) and
//! // verifies that the fractions are fractions, so it can return an error.
//! let mut f = Framework::new(&m, 0.0, 0.0, Instant::now(), rand::thread_rng()).unwrap();
//!
//! // Below is the main loop for operating the framework. This should run
//! // for as long as the underlying connection the framework is attached to
//! // can communicate (user or protocol-specific data, depending on what is
//! // being defended).
//! loop {
//!     // Wait for one or more new events (e.g., on a channel) that should
//!     // be triggered in the framework. Below we just set one example
//!     // event. How you wait and collect events is likely going to be a
//!     // bottleneck. If you have to consider dropping events, it is better
//!     // to drop older events than newer. Ideally, it should be possible
//!     // to process all events one-by-one.
//!     let events = [TriggerEvent::NormalSent];
//!
//!     // Trigger the event(s) in the framework. This takes linear time
//!     // with the number of events but is very fast (time should be
//!     // dominated by a few calls to sample randomness per event per
//!     // machine).
//!     for action in f.trigger_events(&events, Instant::now()) {
//!         // After triggering all the events, the framework will provide
//!         // zero or more actions to take, up to a maximum of one action
//!         // per machine (regardless of the number of events). It is your
//!         // responsibility to perform those actions according to the
//!         // specification. To do so, you will need two timers per
//!         // machine: an action timer (for action timeouts) and an
//!         // internal timer (part of the machine's internal logic). The
//!         // machine identifier (machine in each TriggerAction) uniquely
//!         // and deterministically maps to a single machine running in the
//!         // framework, so it is suitable as a key for a data structure
//!         // storing your timers per framework instance, e.g.,

//!                 // active blocking had bypass set to false, then the
//!                 // padding MUST NOT be sent. This is to support
//!                 // completely fail-closed defenses.
//!                 //
//!                 // If replace is true, then the padding MAY be replaced
//!                 // by another packet. The other packet could be an
//!                 // encrypted packet already queued but not already sent
//!                 // in the tunnel, containing either padding or normal
//!                 // data (ideally, the user of the framework cannot tell,
//!                 // because encrypted). The other data could also be
//!                 // normal data about to be turned into a normal packet
//!                 // and sent. Regardless of if the padding is replaced or
//!                 // not, the event should still be triggered (steps 2).
//!                 // If enqueued normal data sent instead of padding, then
//!                 // the NormalSent event should be triggered as well.
//!                 //
//!                 // Above, note the use case of having bypass and replace
//!                 // set to true. This is to support constant-rate
//!                 // defenses.
//!                 //

//!                 //    taking place (due to any machine), there are two

//!                 //    *remaining* duration to block already in place.
//!                 // 2. Trigger TriggerEvent::BlockingBegin { machine:
//!                 //    machine } regardless of logic outcome in 1. (From
//!                 //    the point of view of the machine, blocking is now
//!                 //    taking place).
//!                 //
//!                 // Note that blocking is global across all machines,
